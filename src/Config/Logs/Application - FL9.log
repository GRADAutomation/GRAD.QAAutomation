09/17/2013 12:13:11 devpinoyLogger Executing verifyObjectTextWithParameter: Certain biological materials like human cartilage have the unique property of viscoelasticity. A viscoelastic material has both the characteristics of a solid and a fluid, and therefore is often analyzed by its solid and fluid components separately. The solid component of the material is modeled as a spring, where the elastic force the material exerts to resist deformation is proportional to the degree of strain, as in Hooke's Law (F = kx, where x is amount of elongation and k is the stiffness, or elasticity, of the material). The fluid component is modeled as a damper, where the viscous force exerted is proportional to the speed of deformation (F = ?v, where v is the speed of elongation and ? is the dampening effect, or viscosity, of the material). Hence, the elastic force will increase with more strain, and the viscous force will increase the faster you strain the material. Using these basic principles, two models have been proposed for the analysis of viscoelastic materials:

A viscoelastic material has both the characteristics of a solid and a fluid, and therefore is often analyzed by its solid and fluid components separately. The solid component of the material is modeled as a spring, where the elastic force the material exerts to resist deformation is proportional to the degree of strain, as in Hooke's Law (F = kx, where x is amount of elongation and k is the stiffness, or elasticity, of the material). The fluid component is modeled as a damper, where the viscous force exerted is proportional to the speed of deformation (F = ?v, where v is the speed of elongation and ? is the dampening effect, or viscosity, of the material). Hence, the elastic force will increase with more strain, and the viscous force will increase the faster you strain the material. Using these basic principles, two models have been proposed for the analysis of viscoelastic materials:

09/17/2013 12:14:16 devpinoyLogger Executing verifyObjectTextWithParameter: Coordination complexes are groups of ions that stay together as a unit even in solution. Coordination complexes of transition metals take a variety of forms and exhibit various colors and magnetic properties. This behavior is directly linked to the unique nature of bonding in coordination complexes. One energy model for coordination complexes is crystal field theory (CFT). According to CFT, the central metal ion is positively charged, while negatively charged ligands surround it. Therefore, the model treats bonding as though it were purely ionic. This model is especially useful for octahedral complexes because of the one-to-one correlation of axes to ligands: one of the six ligands occupies each half of each of the x, y and z axes. The interaction between ligands and the central metal ion cause a perturbation in the energies of the 3d orbitals of the transition metal; some of the orbitals (dz2, dx2y2) have larger repulsions, so their energies are raised by the bonding interaction, while other orbitals (dxy, dxz, dyz) have smaller repulsions resulting in lowered energy levels. Depending upon the strength of the ligand, the crystal field splitting energy (called ?0) between the lower and higher energy levels may be large or small. A large ?0 leads to a complex that is low spin, while a small ?0 leads to a high spin complex.

Both elemental titanium and compounds containing the metal are widely used in medical products, in skywriting chemicals and in thin films for lenses and ceramics. Medical products companies also use titanium in artificial hip replacements for human patients. This metal, which is effectively inert, is ideal for medical use, as even continuous contact with bodily fluids leaves it unchanged. Along with its resistance to corrosion, the low density of titanium makes its use in the body less burdensome than denser metals. One way titanium resists corrosion is to form a thin layer, or skin, of titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is a stable white compound which is formed by the following reaction:

09/17/2013 12:19:35 devpinoyLogger Executing verifyObjectTextWithParameter: Fireworks use a handful of simple compounds to produce an array of dazzling colors. A standard formula requires an oxidizer, a fuel, and metal salts for special effects. The oxidizer and fuel react, producing the noise and flashes commonly associated with fireworks. The purpose of the oxidizer is to provide a high concentration of oxygen within the firework. A typical oxidizer is potassium perchlorate (KClO4), which releases all four of its oxygen atoms into the atmosphere during combustion. The fuel, often sulfur or carbon, binds to the oxygen and produces an extremely hot gas. Metals such as aluminum or magnesium can be used as a fuel; using metals increases the rate at which the oxygen burns while enhancing the brightness of the other colors. Furthermore, using aluminum or magnesium granules will create sparks of light (as is done in sparklers).

09/17/2013 12:23:43 devpinoyLogger Executing verifyObjectTextWithParameter: The interaction of atmospheric and oceanic currents plays a major role in determining climate. Scientists are increasingly concerned that what might appear to be a minor ecological change could cause fluctuations that would greatly change our climate. The ocean's thermohaline circulation directs the flow of the deep ocean and is intricately linked with major climate patterns. Differences in water density drive the thermohaline, or abyssal, circulation. The salinity and temperature of water affect its density. Saltier, colder water sinks in parts of the ocean and warmer, fresher water upwells in other areas. Dense, deep water moves slowly through the oceans. Oceanographers studying the disruption or cessation of the creation of oceanic deep water have found that variations in circulation patterns could have a damaging effect on climate. The creation and sinking of deep water takes place in only a few areas of the world: the Labrador Sea, the Greenland and Norwegian Seas, and parts of the Southern Ocean off the Antarctic coast.

Scientists are increasingly concerned that what might appear to be a minor ecological change could cause fluctuations that would greatly change our climate.

09/17/2013 12:25:32 devpinoyLogger Executing verifyObjectTextWithParameter: In the early nineteenth century a large number of communal experiments, both secular and religious, sprang up in the northeastern United States. Perhaps the most famous secular commune was Brook Farm, founded by transcendentalists George Ripley and William H. Channing to promote the pursuit of leisure and culture through the proper application of time and labor. Its members (among the more notable were Nathaniel Hawthorne and Margaret Fuller) pursued field labor by day, art and philosophy by night. For a time the system worked so well that two afternoons a week were set aside for leisure and Brook Farm began outcompeting local farmers at the produce market. But by nature the Farm's members were thinkers, not workers; despite their success they remained mainly interested in the theoretical and philosophical implications of the experiment. Thus, when a devastating fire brought the community considerable financial burdens in its fifth year, the members felt little compunction about closing shop and returning to their comfortable Boston homes.

Combining anthropology with textual criticism, its practitioners developed what they termed "thick description", using anecdotes gleaned from cultural practices, and intertwining these anecdotes with general studies of the complexities of the culture. Canonical literature, such as the works of Dante, was studied alongside decidedly inferior works by contemporaries who lacked his literary genius.

09/17/2013 12:31:18 devpinoyLogger Executing verifyObjectTextWithParameter: Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a substance that cannot be synthesized by the human body and must be supplied in the diet. Bacteria produce cobalamin, and humans obtain cobalamin by ingesting animal products. The absorption of cobalamin from dietary sources is a multi-step process. First, cobalamin is released from food in the acidic environment of the stomach and binds R-binder, a substance that is found in human saliva and gastric juice. The alkaline pH of the duodenum allows the dissociation of the cobalamin-R-binder complex, and cobalamin is then available to bind intrinsic factor (IF). IF is produced by parietal cells in the stomach, in parallel with parietal cell secretion of HCl. The new cobalamin-IF complex, resistant to proteolytic digestion, travels safely to the ileum, where the complex is bound and taken-up by a specific receptor on the lining cells. Here, the IF is destroyed, and the cobalamin is transferred to a transport protein, transcobalamin, which carries it to the liver for storage and to certain cell types for use.
